# Describes the target device environment in which a test should run. This
# specification is written in JSON to the build directory, to be aggregated
# at test-time.
#
# Parameters
#
#   path (optional for fuchsia; required for host)
#     [string]: The path on the target OS at which the test will be installed.
#
#   target (required)
#     [label]: The test target.
#
#   command (optional)
#     [list of strings]: Command to invoke to run the test. If unset, path is
#     required and will be invoked upon execution.
#
#   package_url (optional)
#     [string] In the case of a fuchsia test, this describes the packaged test
#     via a fuchsia package URL. See //docs/the-book/package_url.md for more
#     details.
#
#   deps (optional)
#     [list of labels]: List of labels that the test depends on.
#
#   environments (optional, default: Emu for fuchsia; else a VM)
#     [list of scopes] Device environments in which the test should run.
#
#     Each scope in $environments contains:
#
#       dimensions (required)
#         [scope] Dimensions of bots to target. Valid dimensions are
#         element-wise subsets of the test platform entries defined in
#         //build/testing/platforms.gni.
#
#       tags (optional)
#         [list of strings] keys on which tests may be grouped. Tests with
#         given tags will be run (1) together, and (2) only with support from
#         the Infrastructure team. Labels are used as an escape hatch from the
#         default testing pipeline for special tests or environments.
#
#    log_settings (optional, default: see below properties)
#      [json] Properties of logs produced by this test run.
#
#      Following properties are supported:
#
#      max_severity (optional, default: WARN)
#        [string] Defines maximum severity of logs which can be produced by test
#        environment. This can only be defined for test components. Test will fail
#        if any component in its environment produces log with greater severity
#        than defined here.
